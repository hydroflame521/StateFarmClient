# [](https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/blob/main/README.md#installation-tutorial)Installation Tutorial:

Before you can install the client, there are a few things you must set up to be able to run userscripts.

1.  Install the proper version of Tampermonkey from  [https://tampermonkey.net/](https://tampermonkey.net/) or any other userscript manager.
    
2.  Make sure you are able to open the extension, and go to the dashboard.
    

Now you are ready to install StateFarm Client:

3.  Go to the releases tab of this GitHub or download the latest client release from the discord server (listed above in this description).
    
4.  Download the client and install it into Tampermonkey.
    

You are done with installation!

5.  Go to  [https://shellshock.io](https://shellshock.io/)  or one of the shell shockers proxies, and use the client!
    
6.  Our list of proxies can be found as a file in the "others" folder in this github repository. Have fun!

# [](https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/blob/main/README.md#features)Features:
## Combat Tab:
-   _**Aimbot**_: locks onto targeted player. The player it locks onto is decided by the targeting type, see below.
-   _**Aimbot Targeting**_: decides the priority for which aimbot should target.
    -   _**Pointing At**_: Closest to direction the camera is pointing.
    -   _**Proximity**_: Closest in distance to player.
-   _**ToggleRM**_: allows for aimbot to be controlled by use of the right mouse button. This option makes it so that the player only locks on while right mouse is held.
-   _**Lock On**_: makes it so that while targeting a player, the target does not switch to another one until aimbot is turned back on.
-   _**Prediction**_: predicts where the player will be when bullet reaches them. Works well! Currently working on nearer to 100% y axis accuracy.
-   _**Antisnap**_: fairly useless feature which creates a smoother transition between selecting a target and focusing on it. Thought it would look less suspect, but does not help greatly.
-   _**AntiSneak**_: Default distance of 1.8, automatically detects and autokills players within this range. Set to 0 to cancel feature.
    -   user is targeting someone far away
    -   enemy player sneaks up behind them
    -   inside a radius of 1.8 BOOM! MAGDUMP on them, then switch to pistol and magdump, then reload and continue
    -   think of it like a tripwire where you are aiming on a target, say, and someone trips within your tripwire's radius now you are firing on them
-   _**Aimbot ESP Color**_: the color that should be used to highlight the ESP of a targeted player.
-   _**Auto Refill**_: refills once ammo is used up.
-   _**Auto Fire**_: fires when locked onto target player. More fun than useful.
-   _**GrenadeMAX**_: sets all grenades thrown to max power.

![combat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/main/images/readme/3-1-3/combat.png)
> _The current player being targeted in the leaderboard in highlighted blue._
> _Crosshair becomes blue when aimbot is enabled._
## Render Tab:
-   _**PlayerESP**_: creates boxes around enemy players.
-   _**Tracers**_: creates lines pointing from the center of the screen to the location of enemy players.
-   _**Chams**_: renders players through walls.
-   _**Nametags**_: enlarges nametags and makes them appear through walls.
-   _**PlayerESP Type**_: determines the scheme to be used to colour the tracers/ESP boxes:
    -   _**Static**_: one color is used, determined by Color 1.
    -   _**Proximity**_: fades between Colors 1-3 based on distance and configuration.
-   _**Color 1**_: static color/color to fade to when player is very close.
-   _**Dist 1->2**_: distance from 0 over which to fade to Color 2.
-   _**Color 2**_: color to indicate player is in range, but not very close. Fades from Color 3, and then to Color 1.
-   _**Dist 2->3**_: same idea as before.
-   _**Color 3**_: color to indicate that player is far from close range, and is more suited to sniping.
-   _**Ammo/Grenades Tracers**_: draws lines when enabled to the item.
-   _**Ammo/Grenades ESP**_: draws boxes around item when enabled.
-   _**Ammo Regime**_:
    -   _**When Depleted**_: activates when you are out of ammo.
    -   _**When low**_: activates when you can only reload twice or less more times.
    -   _**Below Max**_: activates when you're not at max capacity.
    -   _**Always On**_: self explanatory.
-   _**Grenades Regime**_:
    -   _**When Depleted**_: activates when you are out of grenades.
    -   _**When low**_: activates when you have one remaining grenade.
    -   _**Below Max**_: activates when you're not at max capacity (3 grenades).
    -   _**Always On**_: self explanatory.
-   _**Ammo/Grenades ESP Color**_: self explanatory.
-   _**FOV**_: changes fov which you see the map ingame. Higher will zoom out more (above 180 will invert).
-   _**Zoom FOV**_: changes the FOV at which to switch to while holding down the bind related to it (default C). Lower will zoom in more.
-   _**CamWIP**_: one day could be freecam. Currently just moves the camera up a bit.
-   _**Co-ords**_: displays current position in top left corner.
-   _**PlayerStats**_: displays the HP of all the online enemy players.
-   _**Wireframe**_: renders everything as a wireframe.
-   _**Egg size**_: changes size of eggs for lulz.

![render tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/main/images/readme/3-1-3/render.png)
## Chat Tab:
-   _**InfiniHistory**_: disables the default limiting of history from 5 messages to no limit.
-   _**DisableFilter**_: see messages which were filtered for other players! Highlighted in red if a message you or someone else sent has been filtered on non-modified games.
-  _**AntiAFK**_: sends cencored messages periodically that others players will not see but prevents you from being kicked for afk.
-  _**Join msg**_: shows messages in that chat for player joins
-  _**Leave msg**_: shows messages in that chat for player leaves
-   _**HighlightTxt**_: allows you to highlight text from the chat to copy somewhere else.
-   _**Max Ingame**_: limits the amount of messages that will be shown whilst playing (this is needed as InfiniHistory will cause messages to go all the way up the left side).
-   _**Spammer**_: spams chosen text (very annoying and will make all the players in a game mute you. Also likely to get you banned if they implement a measure against this).
-   _**Delay (ms)**_: delay between each message. 0ms works, but higher values at least let people talk somewhat.
-   _**Spam Text**_: text to flood the chat with.

![chat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/main/images/readme/3-1-3/chat.png)
## Misc Tab:
-   _**UnlockSkins**_: unlocks all skins in shellshockers locally, other players will not see them.

![Misc tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/main/images/readme/3-1-3/misc.png)
## Client & About:
-   _**Hide GUI**_: hides upon pressing the button or the keybind (default H).
-   _**Reduce lag**_: reduces lag that the client causes; bigger numbers for more lag reduction. 
-   _**Pop-ups**_: suppose you want to be more "stealthy", you can turn off pop-ups.
-   _**Panic**_: replaces the shell shockers page to a URL of your choice. For educational purposes only.
-   _**Enable Panic**_: if you don't need to use this client for educational purposes only, and it is annoying, you can disable this feature.
-   _**Set Panic URL**_: where it should go.
-   _**Creator's Links**_: to stay up to date.
-   _**Reset**_: deletes all locally stored variables, resetting the client config to defaults.  _Warning_: some are used by the game too so you may lose your saved username and some stats.

## Binding Modules:
With the exception of the color pickers and some links, these should all be bindable to a key of your choice. Press the binds button in the tab, and click on the button next to the module you want to bind. Press a key to bind it, or alternatively press Delete to remove the bind. Use this flexibility to your advantage to be more stealthy, or secure more kills. Eg: switch to **Nearest**  targeting when being attacked, and then to  **Pointing At**  when sniping.

# [](https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/blob/main/README.md#gameplay-strategies)Gameplay Strategies:
-   _**Choose your weapon wisely**_: StateFarm client synergises with certain weapons better than others, use them to your advantage. 
> Aimbot (especially with prediction enabled) is powerful with weapons that require high levels of aim, and weak with weapons that do not rely on aiming.

- _**Use lists tab to even further customise the client**_: use blacklist if you're teaming with someone and whitelist if someone talks smack in chat about you.
- _**Use ESP and Chams to reveal all player locations**_: ESP can allow you to see know player locations, even when they are behind walls/obstacles.
- _**Use Ammo/Grenade ESP to reveal all resource locations**_: Make sure you are never short on resources.
- _**Proximity ESP**_: Use it to gather more info about opponent's distance with you.
- _**Prediction**_: Use prediction to greatly enhance aimbot accuracy.
- _**Lock On**_: Use this feature to prevent aimbot from switching targets.


# [](https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/blob/main/README.md#ban-circumvention)Ban Circumvention:
> BWD has appointed **Eggforcers** that will ban cheaters by **first-person spectating** them.
> If you use a private window and VPN, then you don't have anything to worry about. However, if you don't, or you want to use an account, or you're just interested, we've compiled some info below.

_**Common detection Methods**_:
> Eggforcers (normal players too) will look for the following actions in your gameplay to detection cheating. Avoid overusing them to an extent.
- _**Snapping**_: Immediately locking on to another player after a kill/distance change (use AntiSnap, or only lock on when you have moved the reticle close to the player, or both).
- _**Wall locking**_: Locking on to player though walls.
- _**Unbelievably good aim**_: Inhuman and robotic aiming.

**Booting:**
> This is one of the tools Shell Shockers gives to private game hosters. Booting immediately IP bans every user in a private game sharing an IP, and will not allow them to rejoin that particular game unless they use a VPN/proxy.

**Boot Circumvention:**
> This is circumvented only by using a new IP, or waiting for the host to create a new game.

**"Banning"**:

![ban](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/977271202924097588/1186465326192402614/image.png)

> This is the "ban" interface. It allows "banning" of 5, 15, and 60 minutes. Can only be used by Developers/Eggforcers.
> This is mainly in place to make people feel like they have power, when in fact this is the most useless measure against cheaters.

**"Ban" Circumvention**:
> It is advised to not use an account while using Statefarm, as this method of punishment will apply to your account/browser session.
> If you are "banned", simply deleted cookies and cache of the site and go back (and change account, if you use one).

**Real Bans:**:
> These are only given by the actual developers of the game, who can see the logs and IPs of players. Their tools are more advanced than those of Eggforcer "bans" and can permanently IP ban a user.

**Real Ban Circumvention:**:
> As these are very rare, we have not been able to analyse one of these bans. However, it can be assumed it works like booting, but for the whole game. VPNs/proxies would most likely work just fine.
