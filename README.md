# [](#installation-tutorial)Installation Tutorial:
Before you can install the client, there are a few things you must set up to be able to run userscripts.
1. Install Violentmonkey from [https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) or any other userscript manager. PS: DO NOT use Tampermonkey unless no other option available!
2. Open the Violentmonkey dashboard.
3. Visit the [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482982) page & click `Install this script`.
    - Alternatively, use the raw version from [Github](https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/raw/main/StateFarmClient.js).
4. Visit [https://shellshock.io](https://shellshock.io/) (or another Shell Shockers link), & use StateFarm!

<br>

# [](#getting-started)Getting Started:
> You just installed Statefarm Client...and you're probably confused by all the tabs, sliders, & buttons.
> Below is a few basic ways to start using StateFarm.

- Press 'H' to show/hide the panel. You can also drag it by clicking & dragging `StateFarm` at the top.
- Click on various categories (combat, render, chat, etc) for different areas of cheating.
- Press 'J' to show/hide the botting panel. This allows you to use bots.

Here are some key features to learn:

### Aimbot
Aimbot is one of the key features of StateFarm, it is the most powerful combat module.<br>
To configure the aimbot, open the `Combat` tab.

- If you have an external mouse, activate `ToggleRM` to use the right side of the mouse to toggle aimbot.
- Use `Prediction` & `AntiBloom` to have better accuracy.
- If using a mouse, click the `v` key to enable & disable aimbot.
  
### ESP
Being also named `wall hacks`, these cheats allow you to see players through walls.<br>
To configure ESP, open the `Render` tab.

- To see eggs through walls with **boxes**, enable `PlayerESP`.
- To see all players easily with **lines**, enable `Tracers`.
- To see players' eggs through walls (not guns), enable `Chams`.
- To see nametags through walls, enable `Nametags`.
- You also may want to adjust your FOV with the slider. The default for Shell Shockers is **72**.

<br>

# [](#features) Features:
### Binding Modules:
With the exception of the color pickers and some links, each option should all be bindable to a key of your choice.<br>
1. Visit the upmost tab of the cheat you wish to bind.
2. Click on the `Binds` button.
3. Find the cheat name, and choose `Set Bind` to the right.
   - Some cheats already have binds. To change these, click on the preset key
4. Press the key to bind! It's that simple.
> If you want to remove a bind, press your 'Delete' key instead of a bind.

# [](#adblocking)Adblocking
> Ads are quite an annoying feature. Use the steps below to add a good ad-blocker.<br>
> Use the 'Ad Block' feature in the Misc tab to disable Ad Blocker detection.<br>
> This is unspecific to StateFarm Client but is here as a helpful tip for general user experience improvement.

**Procedure:**
1. Install [uBlock Orgin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - the best adblocker.
    - **uBlock Origin** is NOT **uBlock**. They are **different**.
2. Enable uBlock Origin. That's it. No more ads.

**StateFarm Client is a powerful tool, but like any powerful tool, it can have unintended consequences. We urge you to consider these points before using it:**
- Social Impact: StateFarm Client's functionalities may negatively impact your relationships. Using it excessively could lead to lost friendships, damaged reputations, and social isolation.
- Public Perception: Using StateFarm Client in public lobbies is highly discouraged. It can cause frustration and hostility among others, potentially leading to bans and loss of in-game progress. Be respectful of shared spaces and avoid actions that disrupt others' experiences.
- Loss of Progress: Your usage of StateFarm Client may cause you to lose all of your in-game progress such as "skins", "eggs", or VIP status. You may also be banned in game, which is not our concern.

Remember, be safe & wise on the internet.
