<br>

# [](#installation-tutorial)Installation Tutorial:
Before you can install the client, there are a few things you must set up to be able to run userscripts.
1. Install Violentmonkey from [https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) or any other userscript manager. PS: DO NOT use Tampermonkey unless no other option available!
2. Open the Violentmonkey dashboard.
3. Visit the [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482982) page & click `Install this script`.
    - Alternatively, use the raw version from [Github](https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient/raw/main/StateFarmClient.js).
4. Visit [https://shellshock.io](https://shellshock.io/) (or another Shell Shockers link), & use StateFarm!

<br>

# [](#getting-started)Getting Started:
> You just installed Statefarm Client...and you're probably confused by all the tabs, sliders, & buttons.
> Below is a few basic ways to start using StateFarm.

- Press 'H' to show/hide the panel. You can also drag it by clicking & dragging `StateFarm` at the top.
- Click on various categories (combat, render, chat, etc) for different areas of cheating.
- Press 'J' to show/hide the botting panel. This allows you to use bots.

Here are some key features to learn:

### Aimbot
Aimbot is one of the key features of StateFarm, it is the most powerful combat module.<br>
To configure the aimbot, open the `Combat` tab.

- If you have an external mouse, activate `ToggleRM` to use the right side of the mouse to toggle aimbot.
- Use `Prediction` & `AntiBloom` to have better accuracy.
- If using a mouse, click the `v` key to enable & disable aimbot.
  
### ESP
Being also named `wall hacks`, these cheats allow you to see players through walls.<br>
To configure ESP, open the `Render` tab.

- To see eggs through walls with **boxes**, enable `PlayerESP`.
- To see all players easily with **lines**, enable `Tracers`.
- To see players' eggs through walls (not guns), enable `Chams`.
- To see nametags through walls, enable `Nametags`.
- You also may want to adjust your FOV with the slider. The default for Shell Shockers is **72**.

<br>

# [](#features) Features:
### Binding Modules:
With the exception of the color pickers and some links, each option should all be bindable to a key of your choice.<br>
1. Visit the upmost tab of the cheat you wish to bind.
2. Click on the `Binds` button.
3. Find the cheat name, and choose `Set Bind` to the right.
   - Some cheats already have binds. To change these, click on the preset key
4. Press the key to bind! It's that simple.
> If you want to remove a bind, press your 'Delete' key instead of a bind.

## [](#badges) Badges:
StateFarm Client version 3.4.1-pre71 added custom badges. These badges are displayed to yourself and other StateFarm users next to the respective username, like the golden VIP egg.
There are a number of badges available, and they do stack. Anyone can get the basic StateFarm badge, all you need to do is add "SFC" (not case-sensitive) to your username, and you will see the icon next to your name, as will anyone else using StateFarm.
> These badges are based on usernames and not any other metric, so a user who has a badge is not automatically another StateFarm user, nor are they the real person. The badges are for fun and don't serve to be a verification method.

### Other Available Badges:

- Gold StateFarm: For devs.
- Silver StateFarm: For active server boosters (https://statefarm.onlypuppy7.online).
- Bronze StateFarm: For previous server boosters and other things such as prize winners.
- Basic StateFarm: Adding "sfc" to your username.
- FBI: For Eggforcers.
- Custom Icon: These are for individuals and cannot be requested. They are given at the discretion of onlypuppy7 or another SFC dev.

The badges can be turned off by unchecking "CustomBadges" in the misc tab.

# [](#adblocking)Adblocking
> Ads are quite an annoying feature. Use the steps below to add a good ad-blocker.<br>
> Use the 'Ad Block' feature in the Misc tab to disable Ad Blocker detection.<br>
> This is unspecific to StateFarm Client but is here as a helpful tip for general user experience improvement.

**Procedure:**
1. Install [uBlock Orgin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - the best adblocker.
    - **uBlock Origin** is NOT **uBlock**. They are **different**.
2. Enable uBlock Origin. That's it. No more ads.

**StateFarm Client is a powerful tool, but like any powerful tool, it can have unintended consequences. We urge you to consider these points before using it:**
- Social Impact: StateFarm Client's functionalities may negatively impact your relationships. Using it excessively could lead to lost friendships, damaged reputations, and social isolation.
- Public Perception: Using StateFarm Client in public lobbies is highly discouraged. It can cause frustration and hostility among others, potentially leading to bans and loss of in-game progress. Be respectful of shared spaces and avoid actions that disrupt others' experiences.
- Loss of Progress: Your usage of StateFarm Client may cause you to lose all of your in-game progress such as "skins", "eggs", or VIP status. You may also be banned in game, which is not our concern.

Remember, be safe & wise on the internet.
